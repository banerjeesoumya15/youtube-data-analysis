A note from the official docs: ""The latter two functions perform best for smaller values of n. For larger values, it is more efficient to use the sorted() function. Also, when n==1, it is more efficient to use the built-in min() and max() functions. If repeated usage of these functions is required, consider turning the iterable into an actual heap.""

5bTkiV_Aadc,Python Engineer,How To Schedule Python Scripts As Cron Jobs With Crontab (Mac/Linux) - Python Task Automation,"In this tutorial, we learn about cron jobs and how to schedule commands and Python scripts in the terminal via crontab (for Linux and Mac). This allows us to run commands on a repetitive schedule. We specifically look into running Python scripts as cron jobs. There are a couple of pitfalls where we have to be careful. We also learn how to schedule jobs with a virtual environment.

RNNs are a class of neural networks that is powerful for modeling sequence data such as time series or natural language. Learn how we can use the keras API and work with an input sequence. I also show you how easily we can switch to a gated recurrent unit (GRU) or long short-term memory (LSTM) RNN.

In this Tutorial we learn about this framework and how we can convert our PyTorch code to a Lightning code.

Lightning is nothing more than organized PyTorch code, so once you’ve organized it into a LightningModule, it automates most of the training for you.The beauty of Lightning is that it handles the details of when to validate, when to call .eval(), turning off gradients, detaching graphs, making sure you don’t enable shuffle for val, etc…

All Tips:
1) Iterate with enumerate instead or range(len(x))
2) Use list comprehension instead of raw for loops
3) Sort complex iterables with sorted()
4) Store unique values with Sets
5) Save memory with Generators
6) Define default values in Dictionaries with .get() and .setdefault()
7) Count hashable objects with collections.Counter
8) Format strings with f-Strings (Python 3.6+)
9) Concatenate strings with .join()
10) Merge dictionaries with {**d1, **d2} (Python 3.5+)
11) Simplify if-statements with if x in list

In this Python Advanced Tutorial, we will be learning about Generators in Python. Generators are functions that return an object that can be iterated over. The special thing is that they generate the items inside the object lazily, which means they generate the items only one at a time, and only when you ask for it. Because of this they are much more memory efficient than other sequence objects when you have to deal with large datasets. In this video, we will learn how generators are implemented, the concept behind them, and we will have a look at the advantages and some examples.
