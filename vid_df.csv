A note from the official docs: ""The latter two functions perform best for smaller values of n. For larger values, it is more efficient to use the sorted() function. Also, when n==1, it is more efficient to use the built-in min() and max() functions. If repeated usage of these functions is required, consider turning the iterable into an actual heap.""

bi0cKgmRuiA,Python Engineer,Docker Tutorial For Beginners - How To Containerize Python Applications,"In this Docker Tutorial I show how to get started with Docker for your Python Scripts and Python Web Apps. We look at two different projects and build Docker Containers for a Python script and for a web application using FastAPI (works the same for Flask). This also demonstrates how to dockerize a virtual environment.

g2t7M2HTZ9U,Python Engineer,TensorFlow Tutorial 04 - Linear Regression - Full Project Walkthrough,"New Tutorial series about TensorFlow 2! Learn all the basics you need to get started with this deep learning framework!

Part 04 - Linear Regression

In this part we implement a full project with a Regression problem. We learn how to download, analyze, and preprocess data with pandas. We then build a simple Linear Model using the keras.Dense layer and predict new values. Then extend this model to a deep neural network and learn about the importance of activation functions.

Lightning is nothing more than organized PyTorch code, so once you‚Äôve organized it into a LightningModule, it automates most of the training for you.The beauty of Lightning is that it handles the details of when to validate, when to call .eval(), turning off gradients, detaching graphs, making sure you don‚Äôt enable shuffle for val, etc‚Ä¶

2) Use list comprehension instead of raw for loops
3) Sort complex iterables with sorted()
4) Store unique values with Sets
5) Save memory with Generators
6) Define default values in Dictionaries with .get() and .setdefault()
7) Count hashable objects with collections.Counter
8) Format strings with f-Strings (Python 3.6+)
9) Concatenate strings with .join()
10) Merge dictionaries with {**d1, **d2} (Python 3.5+)
11) Simplify if-statements with if x in list

In this part we improve the code from the last part and will learn how a complete training pipeline is implemented in PyTorch. We replace the manually computed loss and weight updates with a loss and an optimizer from the PyTorch framework, which can do the optimization for us. We will then see how a PyTorch model is implemented and used for the forward pass.

In this Python Advanced Tutorial, we will be learning about Generators in Python. Generators are functions that return an object that can be iterated over. The special thing is that they generate the items inside the object lazily, which means they generate the items only one at a time, and only when you ask for it. Because of this they are much more memory efficient than other sequence objects when you have to deal with large datasets. In this video, we will learn how generators are implemented, the concept behind them, and we will have a look at the advantages and some examples.
